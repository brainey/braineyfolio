LINK_TEXT

# You can omit any tag of any entry and it will just be empty.  Any
# entry not marked professional goes in personal.  The links with
# class "fancybox" in pictures will open a lightbox when clicked on.
# The outer link (a href) contains the image that will appear when
# clicked on.  The inner img tag contains the thumbnail, which can be
# the same image if you're not worried about bandwidth.

# Ruby allows single-quoted or double-quoted strings, or shell-style
# strings with <<END_STRING, which go until you see END_STRING on a
# line by itself.  All of them are just strings, though.
#
# In double-quoted strings you can use "#{ruby code}" to embed ruby
# code in your strings.
#
# Those things with the colon on the front are symbols.  They're
# basically like strings as far as you're concerned.
