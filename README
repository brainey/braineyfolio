Bobfolio is a simple attempt to trim down my personal portfolio and
convert it into a little Sinatra web app for easy use with Heroku.

INSTALLING BOBFOLIO:

First, install git.  On Ubuntu that's something like "apt-get install
git-core".  On Mac, you've probably already got it, or you can install
it through MacPorts, Fink, Homebrew or whatever.

Next, "git clone git://github.com/noahgibbs/bobfolio.git".  That will
make a bobfolio directory for you to edit your new copy.

You'll need to install Ruby.  If you install Ruby 1.8.X instead of
1.9.X, you'll also need to install RubyGems.

Afterward, you'll need to install other gems:

  gem install bundler
  bundle install

RUNNING BOBFOLIO:

From the command line, type "rerun ./bobfolio.rb".  That will load a
web server, and reload the web server every time you change the code
(convenient!).

Next, point a web browser at "http://localhost:4567" to see what your
server shows.  Edit index.html.erb until you like what you see.

DEPLOYING BOBFOLIO:

Sign up for a (free) account with Heroku.com.  Next, create a Heroku
app:

  heroku create myappname

Heroku will ask you for your name and password the first time you run
a command, and will remember your SSH keys so you can upload code to
this app again later.  It may take a try or three before your app name
isn't taken.  You can also just "heroku create" to create a new
randomized app name.  Don't do that for your portfolio, because a
randomized app name will be hard to remember and sound kind of dumb.

Now deploy to heroku:

  git push heroku master

That's it!  Go to "http://myappname.heroku.com" or whatever your
actual Heroku app name is.  You should see your new portfolio,
accessible to all on the big ol' Internet.  Welcome to the future.
